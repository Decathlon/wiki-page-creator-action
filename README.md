## Common usage
The action requires some content _markdown/wiki pages_ that must be generated on a previous step, and located into a specific folder.  
This action scans the folder, adds its files, and finally publishes them to the wiki.

## Use GitHub action

__*Please note that this action requires your repo to already own at least one page in the wiki section: https://github.com/:yourOrganization/:yourRepository/wiki*__


### Settings for v2.0.0+ release
```YAML
- name: Upload Release Notes to Wiki
  uses: docker://decathlon/wiki-page-creator-action:2.0.1
  env:
    GH_PAT: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}
    ACTION_MAIL: youremail@mail.com
    ACTION_NAME: yourusername
    OWNER: yourGitHubOrganisation
    REPO_NAME: yourGitHubRepository
```

### Environment Variables options

To be able to push the new Wiki Page, the action requires some environment variables/secrets:
* **GH_PAT**: (required) GitHub Private Access Token used for the clone/push operations. The token is used for security reasons, instead of the username/password, and because is the only way to access to repositories for organizations using SSO. You can [click here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo&description=wiki%20page%20creator%20token) to generate this token.

* **ACTION_MAIL**: (required) email used to push new wiki pages into the target repository
* **ACTION_NAME**: (required) username to use in the push command
* **OWNER**: (required) repository owner name.
* **REPO_NAME**: (required) repository name where you want to upload the wiki page to.
* **MD_FOLDER**: (optional - default is the current folder) folder to scan for markdown files
* **SKIP_MD**: (optional - all files will be processed) comma separated list of files to skip during the analysis (files you don't want to publish)
* **WIKI_PUSH_MESSAGE**: (optional - sample message will use instead) Custom push message for your wiki pages.

## Full Example (with additional actions to generate content)

The following one is the workflow we are using to push the release notes to our project wikis.

In this example the workflow is started `on milestone`; the first action is filtering on the `closed` action of the milestone (if milestone is created, renamed, ... the other steps are skipped).

The `create-release-notes-action` creates the markdown file (check [here](https://github.com/Decathlon/release-notes-generator-action) if your need more information). 
The output file is stored into the `temp_release_notes`.

The `wiki-page-creator-action` takes all the markdown files from the `temp_release_notes` folder (skipping a README.md file if found) and uploads them to the provided wiki repo.

### Using v2.0.0+

```YAML
on: 
  milestone:
    types: [closed]
name: Milestone Closure
jobs:
  release-notes:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@master
    - name: Create Release Notes
      uses: docker://decathlon/release-notes-generator-action:2.0.0
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        OUTPUT_FOLDER: temp_release_notes
        USE_MILESTONE_TITLE: "true"
    - name: Upload Release Notes to Wiki
      uses: docker://decathlon/wiki-page-creator-action:latest

        GH_PAT: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}
        MD_FOLDER: temp_release_notes
